### How to create/fork repos for weekly problem sets and monthly project challenges
- For the weekly problem sets, create a fork of the weekly-problem-set repo and save that fork to your personal profile with the name style "[your-name]-weekly-problem-set". I can view all the forks of the repo, so I'll be able to see people's work. 
- For monthly projects, you should create a new repo under the "LaunchCode-Code-Connect" group and give it a name like "[your-name]-[project-month-and-year]-[name-describing-project]. Example: "christian-frauenhoffer-dec-2024-todo-app". That way, we can easily keep track of your engagement with the project challenges.

**If you would like us to be able to see your engagement with this group, please make any forked repo or newly created repo publicly viewable.**
